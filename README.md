--------INFO---------

    This is my 'Hello World' project for machine learning. I used the MNIST data to train my model.
The training examples contain 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. I used tensorflow flow to
build a neural network with 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer. The layers have 512, 256, and 128 neurons
respectively. The output layer is 10 neurons with linear activation function. Softmax is applied when reading the
model's results to make a final prediction. It is likely that a functioning model can be built with even smaller 
amount of nodes in each layer.

The GUI uses web-based technologies such as javascript, HTML and css along with electron that is hooked up to an 
executable program written with python.

Received help from gpt4 when building the front-end.
